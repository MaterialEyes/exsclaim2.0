# Using install_and_run.sh due to a issue that occurred from running
# npm install in the Dockerfile and then attaching a volume to allow
# live updates. The root of the issue is that npm install creates 
# node_modules in container, and mounting local directory afterward
# made node_modules match the possible incorrect local node_modules.
# Three solutions were considered:
#     idea: use bash script to run npm install AFTER bind mount and 
#         then npm start (check that node_modules doesn't exist)
#     idea: have users npm install locally -- potential mess of 
#         different versions? defeats whole purpose of Docker
#     idea: modify node modules path and move to different directory 
#         in container -- lose syntax highlighting and nice features
