## Introduction to EXSCLAIM2.0

EXSCLAIM2.0 is a Python package combining EXSCLAIM! code with Large Language models (LLMs) that can be used for the automatic generation of datasets of labeled images from published papers.
There are four main steps:
1. [JournalScraper](https://github.com/MaterialEyes/exsclaim2.0/wiki/JournalScraper): scrap journal websites, acquiring figures, captions, and metadata
2. [HTMLScraper](https://github.com/MaterialEyes/exsclaim2.0/wiki/HTMLScraper): scrap user provided HTML files, acquiring figures, captions, and metadata 
3. [CaptionDistributor](https://github.com/MaterialEyes/exsclaim2.0/wiki/CaptionDistributor): separate figure captions into the component chunks that refer to the figure's subfigures using LLMs and prompt engineering
4. [FigureSeparator](https://github.com/MaterialEyes/exsclaim2.0/wiki/FigureSeparator): separate figures into subfigures, detect scale information, label, and type of image

## Examples and tutorials
We provide several tutorials demonstrating how to use EXSCLAIM2.0:
1. [Nature_exsclaim_search](/notebooks/1_Nature_exsclaim_search.ipynb): automatically scrapping data from literature and performing Named Entity Recognition (NER) on the extracted captions.
2. [HTMLScraper](/notebooks/2_HTMLScraper.ipynb): automatically scrapping data from user provided HTML files
3. [Microscopy_CLIP_retrieval](/notebooks/3_Microscopy_CLIP_retrieval.ipynb): Using Microscopy_CLIP to perform image-to-image and text-to-image retrieval on our multimodal microscopy dataset.


## Installation
The guides to install EXSCLAIM through Pip, Git and Docker can be found within the [wiki](https://github.com/MaterialEyes/exsclaim2.0/wiki/Installation).

### Using Exsclaim 2.0
```python
from exsclaim import Pipeline
search_query = {
		...
}
results = Pipeline(search_query_json)
```
where `search_query` is either a dictionary representing a valid JSON object, or a Pathlike string pointing towards a valid JSON file,
or 
```shell
python -m exsclaim query {path to json file holding search query}
```
More extensive guides can be found within the [wiki](https://github.com/MaterialEyes/exsclaim2.0/wiki/Running-the-EXSCLAIM-Pipeline).

### Using Docker Compose
To use Docker Compose to host the service, run the following commands in the base directory:
```shell
docker compose build base
docker compose build {service(s) here}
docker compose up {service(s) here}
```
